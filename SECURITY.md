# OpenAI API Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the secure implementation of OpenAI API integration in this project.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Only API Key Storage
- ✅ OpenAI API key is stored only in Netlify environment variables
- ✅ API key is never exposed to client-side code
- ✅ No `VITE_` prefixed environment variables for OpenAI API key

### 2. Secure Architecture
- ✅ All OpenAI API calls are made through Netlify serverless functions
- ✅ Client-side code only communicates with our secure endpoints
- ✅ API key is only accessible server-side in the Netlify function

### 3. CORS Protection
- ✅ Restricted CORS origins to allowed domains only
- ✅ Proper CORS headers implementation
- ✅ Security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP) included

### 4. Input Validation
- ✅ Request validation and sanitization
- ✅ Type checking for all parameters
- ✅ Error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Environment Variable Setup

### Local Development
- No OpenAI API key needed in local `.env` file
- All AI features work through the deployed Netlify function

### Production (Netlify)
Set the following environment variable in your Netlify dashboard:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_new_openai_api_key_here
```

## Files Modified for Security

1. **`.env`** - Removed OpenAI API key
2. **`.env.example`** - Updated with security notes
3. **`src/lib/services/aiService.ts`** - Removed client-side OpenAI calls
4. **`netlify/functions/generate-content.ts`** - Enhanced security measures

## Testing the Implementation

1. Ensure the new OpenAI API key is set in Netlify environment variables
2. Deploy the updated code to Netlify
3. Test AI features in the application
4. Verify that no API keys are visible in browser developer tools

## Security Checklist

- [ ] New OpenAI API key obtained from OpenAI dashboard
- [ ] Old API key revoked in OpenAI dashboard
- [ ] New API key set in Netlify environment variables
- [ ] Code deployed to production
- [ ] AI features tested and working
- [ ] Browser developer tools checked (no API keys visible)
- [ ] Git history cleaned if old key was committed

## Emergency Response

If an API key is ever compromised:
1. Immediately revoke the key in OpenAI dashboard
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update the Netlify environment variable
4. Redeploy if necessary
5. Monitor usage for any unauthorized activity
